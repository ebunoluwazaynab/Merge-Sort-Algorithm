# Merge-Sort-Algorithm
This is a Python implementation of the merge sort algorithm. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively breaks down an array into two halves, sorts each half independently, and then merges the sorted halves back together to produce a final sorted array.
